# molecular-dynamics
A simulation of Ar molecules interacting with Lennard-Jones potential

# Goal:
Complete problem 9.11 from Giordano and Nakanishi's book:

**9.11** Study the melting transition at different densities. You should find that the melting temperature drops as the density is reduced. For 16 particles in a box of size 4.3 x 4.3, you should find melting near T = 1.0
